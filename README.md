# Google-Scholar
A simple crawler that crawls Google-Scholar. Google Scholar does not have any API that allows us to crawl the papers.
This Python code crawls the Scholar site based on User Query.

<b>WARNING : </b> <b> Scholar does not allow Robots.</b> So too much of running this code will result in you being blocked or denied access by Google Scholar temporarily.
